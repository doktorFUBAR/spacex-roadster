# SpaceX Roadster :rocket:

## A microsite using the SpaceX API (Project Exam 1)
This is my project exam for the first year of studying front-end development at Noroff.
I was tasked with making a microsite for SpaceX or Nasa, focused on space technology.

## Coded in:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## About the project
I chose to work with the SpaceX API (https://docs.spacexdata.com/).
The reason for this, is my general interest in the company and their impact on space travel in general.

I chose children as the target audience, as I wanted to go for a illustrated style on this website.
The assets used on this website is a combination of my own, and licenced assets found online.

The website contains various dynamic data collected from the API (everything from dimensions on different rockets to the velocity of the Tesla Roadster).

I was also tasked with making a HTML form with JS validation.

## Result
The live site can bee seen here: http://willand.no/spacex-roadster/
The website is responsive, and contains various CSS animations to make it more engaging and fun for the target audience.
Nothing too crazy going on with the website, but absolutely a fun challenge when it was presented.
